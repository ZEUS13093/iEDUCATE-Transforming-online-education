       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Digital platforms and mobile learning applications have made education more accessible than ever, reaching even the most remote corners of the world. Government policies and non-profit organizations are increasingly prioritizing literacy, recognizing it as a fundamental human right and a cornerstone for economic growth, social inclusion, and individual empowerment. This era signifies not just the reduction of illiteracy rates but the dawn of a world where everyone has the tools to read, write, and harness the full potential of their intellect and creativity.</p>

       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society.</p>

       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In prehistory, education primarily occurred informally through oral communication and imitation. With the emergence of ancient civilizations, the invention of writing led to an expansion of knowledge, prompting a transition from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was largely accessible to elites and religious groups. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century facilitated widespread access to books, thus increasing general literacy. In the 18th and 19th centuries, public education gained significance, paving the way for the global movement to provide primary education to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. Presently, over 90% of primary-school-age children worldwide attend primary school.
